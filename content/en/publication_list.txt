The X-ray spectra were measured by a Si(Li) detector (FWHM = 139 eV at 5.9 keV) and analyzed off-line using GUPIX software. The validity of the proposed method has been checked through its application to NIST standard samples. The concentrations of the elements have been determined in the standard samples are in agreement with the certified values within the error limits.

abstract = {The dependences of the depth and mass resolutions of analysis using Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) on some experimental conditions (such as the beam energy, the target tilting angle, etc.) have been investigated. A computer program for simulating the RBS spectra and for calculating the depth and mass resolution under different experimental conditions was developed. The results of calculation were experimentally checked by using some reference samples. The good agreements between calculated and experimental values have been found. The optimum analysis conditions over a wide range of RBS applications based on our calculation can be chosen. This investigation was conducted by using the RBS system at HUS 5SDH-2 Tandem accelerator at the Hanoi University of Science.}

All obtained Raman scattering lines are discussed in details to shed light onto structural changes during ion implantation. There appears new resonance peak at around 550 cm−1, which splits from broad features in the spectra, and attributes to the anti-symmetric vibrations of O6 cages. The blue shift of this peak scales to {\textasciitilde}2.4 cm−1 per 1 GPa of stress. Another strong feature showing considerable blue shift is seen in the vicinity of 640 cm−1 and corresponds to one of rhombohedral distortion related soft modes. A weak mode, not frequently reported, is seen at around 420 cm−1 and corresponds to translation-like motions of fixed O6 cages.},

abstract = {Understanding of the fate of phytolith in soils is important because of its role as an agronomical nutrient resource and for carbon sequestration. Accumulation of phytolith derived silica occurs in paddy soils when phytolith input, here through straw incorporation, is higher than silica removal through crop offtake, dissolution and leaching. Phytolith dissolution is thought to be the main reason for diminishing of phytolith derived silica in soil, with this dissolution being highly dependent on soil chemical properties. In this study, phytolith content from 78 paddy soils sampled in the Red River (RRD) and Mekong River (MRD) Deltas, Vietnam, were quantified and related to pH, electrical conductivity (EC), oxalate-extractable Al and Fe (Alox and Feox), organic carbon (OC) and clay content. Average phytolith contents within the topsoil (0–20 cm) were 4.8 ± 1.98 and 7.74 ± 2.97 mg g−1 for the RRD and MRD, respectively. Positive correlation coefficients obtained for Alox, OC, clay content and EC, implying that these parameters might enhance phytolith resistance to dissolution. Soil pH had a negative correlation coefficient with phytolith content. Lower pH and higher Alox content explained the predominance of the phytolith in the MRD compared to the RRD. Soil pH adjustment can be proposed as an active management strategy to maintain phytolith added Si, source for crops and for carbon sequestration.}

abstract = {The effects of moisture content, grain size, temperature, major elemental composition, and the pH of soils on the radon emanation and diffusion coefficients were evaluated in this study. The emanation and diffusion coefficients are strongly influenced by moisture content and grain size. The radon emanation coefficient increased and the diffusion coefficient decreased with decreasing particle size. However, for soils with large particle sizes, the radon emanation and diffusion coefficient remain almost unchanged with variation in grain size. Comparing five different sized soil particles, the emanation coefficient increased and the diffusion coefficient decreased with moisture content. The radon emanation coefficient reached a constant value with different moisture contents depending on the range of grain sizes. The saturation emanation coefficient for less than 0.1, 0.1–0.2, 0.2–0.3, 0.3–0.5, and more than 0.5 mm sized soil grain ranges are 0.47, 0.42, 0.35, 0.26 and 0.23, respectively, with saturation moisture contents of 16%, 14%, 10%, 6% and 4%, respectively. A drastic increase in radon emanation is found at smaller grain sizes with increasing moisture content. Based on the content of major elements and pH of the soils, the multiple regression indicates that the radon emanation coefficient appears to be significantly dependent on iron content and pH. Effective diffusion coefficient values calculated in our study agree with the results calculated by a previous model. Experimental values show that the temperature dependence of the radon diffusion coefficient follows Arrhenius behavior.}

The contraction of lattice upon the addition of other elements is very rare and extraordinary in the solid-state, not only for gold but also for many other solids. To explain the underlying physics, the pure kinetic theory of absorption is not adequate and the detailed interaction of hydrogen in the lattice needs to be clarified. Our analysis points to the importance of the formation of hydride bonds in a dynamic manner and explains why these bonds become weak at higher doses, leading to the inverse process of volume expansion frequently seen in metallic hydrogen containers.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of tin (Sn) ion irradiation on the local structure and flux pinning properties of 412-nm-thick MgB2 thin films. Ions with 2 MeV incident energy were irradiated onto MgB2 thin films at room temperature and various dose levels from 2 × 1012 to 7 × 1013 atoms/cm2. X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure results confirmed extended average bond lengths and increased mean-square relative displacement that correlated with crystalline disorder serving as artificial pinning centers induced by ion irradiation. While the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) exhibited a decreasing trend, the magnetization Jc (H) of the irradiated films measured at both 5 K and 20 K were remarkably enhanced compared to that of pristine films at high applied magnetic fields. The decreases in exponent β from 1.1 and 1.13 to 0.69 and 0.62 after irradiation at 5 K and 20 K, respectively, as the dose increased to 5 × 1013 atoms/cm2 indicates a shift in the pinning mechanism from weak collective pinning to strong plastic pinning according to collective pinning theory. In addition, the scaling behavior of the flux pinning force density (Fp) in the irradiated MgB2 films showed a crossover from surface pinning to normal point pinning. These results suggest that intermediate-energy irradiation by heavy ions such as Sn generates effective pinning sources for improving Jc(H) in MgB2 superconductors.}

Raman spectroscopy has been used to examine the behavior of electron-phonon coupling (EPC). For the superconductivity properties, the temperature dependence resistivity, R(T), and the magnetic field-dependent magnetization, M(H), were measured. The import of EPC, which is related to the change in critical temperature (Tc), was calculated using the McMillan-formula modified by Allen–Dynes, using the phonon frequency of the middle peak center ω2(E2g). Raman spectroscopy showed that the value of EPC decreased from 1.113 (Pristine) to 0.969 (7E13). Although the critical temperature (Tc) decreased with increasing Sn2+ ion doses, the values of the in-field critical current density (Jc) and upper critical field (Hc2) increased and reached a maximum for the 5E13 sample. In addition, the magnetic penetration depths of the pristine and optimal dose (5E13) samples were measured using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), providing the thermodynamic critical field (Hc) in the MgB2 films.}
