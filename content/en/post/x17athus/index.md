VTV2 - the national television channel: Pelletron accelerator of the Faculty of Physics - University of Science and Technology conducting series of experiments searching for X17 particle. This is a modern "million dollar" equipment equipped for training and scientific research at the Faculty of Physics.

University of Natural Sciences, VNU is a leading university in the field of basic sciences. With the responsibility to create, disseminate and develop knowledge, provide talented human resources, high quality and scientific and technological products of high value to the society, actively contribute to the development of basic science of the country.

Because of the above tasks, the University has long invested in, installed and put into use electrostatic accelerators. From the beginning of its use, the University has determined that the Accelerator will serve as a machine, linked to the existing equipment and will be completed synchronously to create a scientific equipment base that can perform basic research and applications, thereby training human resources for the nuclear research and applications.

With a lot of experiments on the accelerator that the University of Natural Sciences is doing has helped a lot for the teaching, research of faculty, students and scientists. In particular, now, the accelerator is conducting experimental steps on a problem that astrophysics is very interested in - that is the search for dark matter in the universe. The research project is being conducted with Hungarian scientists and lecturers, scientists of the University of Science and Technology.

Scientists have observed on the accelerator of the University of Science and Technology X17 particle. This particle was previously discovered at the accelerator in Hungary. X17 particle has an important role in explaining anomalies in nuclear reactions; can set the world that we are seeing with dark matter.
